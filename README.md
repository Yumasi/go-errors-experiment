# What is this ?

This is a small experiment to learn how errors work in Go in a way compatible
with TDD and if possible having `const` error values. A secondary goal of mine
was to use TDD to check the behaviour effortlessly and simply for practicing
reasons. For explanation on its behaviour, see the tests.
